# Action Plan Feature - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Database Schema**
Added two new models to Prisma schema:
- **ActionPlan**: Stores main action plan details with status tracking
- **ActionPlanTask**: Stores individual tasks within each action plan

Features include:
- Priority levels (1-5)
- Status tracking (not_started, in_progress, completed, blocked)
- Impact/Effort assessment
- Deadline management
- Notes and blockers sections
- Task checklists with completion tracking

### 2. **Action Plan Detail Page** 
`/report/[slug]/action-plan/[planId]/page.tsx`

Comprehensive editing interface with:
- **Basic Information**: Title, description, category, priority
- **Status & Timeline**: Current status, deadline, timeframe, estimated value
- **Task Checklist**: Add/edit/delete individual tasks with completion checkboxes
- **Notes & Blockers**: Free-text areas for additional context
- Auto-save functionality
- Visual status indicators

### 3. **Action Plans Overview Page**
`/report/[slug]/action-plans/page.tsx`

Dashboard view showing:
- All action plans for a report
- Status filters (not started, in progress, completed, blocked)
- Progress bars for task completion
- Priority and category badges
- Quick access to edit each plan

### 4. **API Endpoints**
Created RESTful API routes:
- `GET/POST /api/reports/[slug]/action-plans` - List all plans or create new
- `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/reports/[slug]/action-plans/[planId]` - CRUD operations for individual plans

### 5. **Integration with Insights**
Updated `ActionableInsights.tsx` component:
- "View Details" buttons now work
- Automatically creates action plans with pre-filled data
- Shows "Edit Plan" if plan already exists, "Create Plan" if new
- Quick wins section has "Create Action Plan" buttons

## üìã How to Use

3. **Manual Creation**:

```

### File Structure
```
app/
  report/[slug]/
    action-plan/
      [planId]/
        page.tsx          # Detail/edit page
    action-plans/
      page.tsx           # Overview page
  api/reports/[slug]/
    action-plans/
      route.ts           # List/Create API
      [planId]/
        route.ts         # CRUD API

components/report/
  ActionableInsights.tsx  # Updated with links
```

## üöÄ Next Steps / Enhancements

Potential future improvements:
1. Email notifications for approaching deadlines
2. Assignee field for team collaboration
3. File attachments for action plans
4. Export to PDF/CSV
5. Bulk operations (complete all, delete multiple)
6. Templates for common action plans
7. Dependencies between action plans
8. Time tracking per task
9. Comments/activity log
10. Integration with project management tools

## üêõ Known Issues

1. **Routing Conflict**: There's a minor conflict between `[reportId]` and `[slug]` routes that may need addressing
2. **Prisma Generation**: May need manual Prisma client generation after schema changes
3. **Real-time Updates**: Changes don't reflect immediately in other tabs (no WebSocket implementation)

## Usage Example

When you click "View Details" on a prioritized task like "Implement conversion tracking":
1. System checks if an action plan with that title exists
2. If not, creates new plan with:
   - Title: "Implement conversion tracking"
   - Category: "conversion"
   - Status: "not_started"
   - Pre-filled deadline and priority
3. User can then:
   - Add specific tasks (e.g., "Set up GA4 goals", "Configure e-commerce tracking")
   - Set a deadline
   - Add implementation notes
   - Track progress by checking off tasks
   - Mark as blocked if dependencies arise
