## How to Use

### For Admins

1. **Adding Keywords to a Client**:
   - Navigate to client report management
   - Use the KeywordManagement component
   - Enter keywords (one per line)
   - Click "Save Tracked Keywords"
   - System will fetch initial data from Google Search Console

2. **Monitoring Keywords**:
   - Keywords are automatically updated weekly
   - View performance in client reports
   - Check position changes and trends

### For Clients

1. **Viewing Keyword Performance**:
   - Access report via share link
   - Keywords section shows tracked keywords
   - View metrics: position, clicks, impressions, CTR
   - See position changes with visual indicators

2. **Manual Refresh**:
   - Click "Refresh" button in keywords section
   - Updates data from Google Search Console
   - 5-minute cooldown between refreshes

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
1. Keywords are stored in the `Keyword` table
2. Performance data is fetched from Google Search Console API
3. Weekly snapshots are stored in `KeywordPerformance` table
4. Position changes are calculated comparing to previous week
5. Alerts are generated for significant changes (>5 positions)

### Rate Limiting
- Manual refresh: 5-minute cooldown per report
- API calls: 100ms delay between keyword fetches
- Cron job: 1-second delay between clients

### Error Handling
- Failed API calls don't stop the entire process
- Individual keyword failures are logged
- Placeholder data inserted for failed fetches
- Comprehensive error logging for debugging

## Security Features
- CRON_SECRET validation for automated jobs
- Rate limiting on manual refresh
- Data isolation per client report
- Audit logging for all operations

## Performance Optimizations
- Batch processing for multiple keywords
- Database indexes on frequently queried fields
- Efficient position change calculations
- Cached performance data in database

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- SERP features detection (featured snippets, PAA)
- Competitor comparison
- Keyword grouping and campaigns
- Local SEO support with location tracking
- Multi-device tracking (desktop vs mobile)
- Seasonal trend analysis
- Content gap identification

## Monitoring
- Check cron job execution in Vercel dashboard
- Monitor Google API quota usage
- Review error logs for failed updates
- Track database performance metrics

## Troubleshooting

### Keywords Not Updating
1. Check if cron job is running (Vercel dashboard)
2. Verify CRON_SECRET is set correctly
3. Check Google API token validity
4. Review error logs in Vercel

### Manual Refresh Not Working
1. Check 5-minute cooldown hasn't been triggered
2. Verify Google Search Console property access
3. Check API quota limits
4. Review browser console for errors

### Position Data Missing
1. Keyword might not have search volume
2. Google Search Console 2-3 day delay
3. Property might not have data for keyword
4. Check if keyword is spelled correctly

## Dependencies
- `googleapis`: Google APIs client library
- `@prisma/client`: Database ORM
- Next.js 14: Framework
- TypeScript: Type safety
- Vercel: Hosting and cron jobs

## Deployment Notes
- Database schema is automatically synced via Prisma
- Cron job configuration in vercel.json
- Environment variables must be set in Vercel dashboard
- CRON_SECRET should be different in production

This implementation provides a robust, scalable keyword tracking system that integrates seamlessly with the existing reporting platform while providing valuable SEO insights for clients.
