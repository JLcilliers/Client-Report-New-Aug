# Task 4 Completion Status

## Task 4: Implement Dynamic Recommendations System

### Completed Steps:
- ✅ Step 1: Fixed syntax error at line 225
- ✅ Step 2: Added recommendations state to component
- ✅ Step 3: Created generateRecommendations function
- ✅ Step 4: Called generateRecommendations from fetchAllReportData
- ✅ Step 5: Converted all recommendation cards to dynamic rendering
  - Removed file corruption at lines 199-223
  - Converted Major Projects card to dynamic rendering
  - Converted Fill-ins card to dynamic rendering  
  - Converted Consider Later card to dynamic rendering
  - Quick Wins card was already converted in previous session

### Dynamic Rendering Pattern Applied:
All four recommendation cards now use the filter/map pattern:
```typescript
{recommendations
  .filter(rec => rec.category === 'CATEGORY_NAME')
  .map((rec, idx) => (
    <li key={idx} className="flex items-start gap-2">
      <span className="text-COLOR mt-0.5">•</span>
      <span><strong>{rec.title}:</strong> {rec.description}</span>
    </li>
  ))}
```

Categories:
- 'quick-wins' - red-400 color scheme
- 'major-projects' - orange-400 color scheme
- 'fill-ins' - blue-400 color scheme
- 'consider-later' - gray-400 color scheme

## Next Tasks:
- Verify data accuracy against actual Google Search Console and Analytics for FSE Digital
- Test all changes
- Deploy to production
