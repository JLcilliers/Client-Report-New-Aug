# AI Visibility Dashboard Implementation Progress

## Project Goal
Implement an AI Visibility Dashboard feature that displays metrics from AI platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews) with overall scores, sentiment analysis, share of voice, citations, and accuracy scores.

## Critical Fix Applied
**Routing Conflict Resolution:**
- Issue: Next.js error "You cannot use different slug names for the same dynamic path ('id' !== 'reportId')"
- Root Cause: Both [id] and [reportId] folders existed at app/api/admin/reports/
- Fix Applied:
  - ✅ Deleted conflicting [id] folder (verified with Test-Path)
  - ✅ Cleared .next build cache (verified with Test-Path)
  - ⏭️ Dev server restart required to apply changes
