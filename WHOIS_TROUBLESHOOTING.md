# WHOIS API Troubleshooting

## Current Status
The WHOIS API key provided (`at_TS4qOdiR5kiAgg0pA2IfRTAjxVpvW`) is showing authentication errors.

## How to Verify Your API Key

1. **Log into WhoisXMLAPI Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://whoisxmlapi.com/dashboard
   - Check your API keys section

2. **Verify API Key Format**
   - Should start with `at_`
   - Should be about 32 characters long
   - Example: `at_TS4qOdiR5kiAgg0pA2IfRTAjxVpvW`

3. **Check API Key Status**
   - Make sure it's "Active"
   - Check if it needs email verification
   - Ensure your account is activated

## Test Your API Key

You can test your API key directly in the browser:
```
https://www.whoisxmlapi.com/whoisserver/WhoisService?apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY&domainName=google.com&outputFormat=JSON
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual key.

## Common Issues & Solutions

### 1. "ApiKey authenticate failed"
**Possible Causes:**
- API key not activated yet
- Account email not verified
- Typo in the API key
- API key was regenerated

**Solution:**
- Check your email for activation link
- Log into dashboard and verify key is active
- Copy the key directly from the dashboard

### 2. Getting a Different API Key Format
If your dashboard shows a different format (not starting with `at_`):
- You might be looking at a different product's API key
- Make sure you're in the "WHOIS API" section, not Domain Availability API or other services

### 3. Free Tier Not Activated
- New accounts might need manual approval
- Check if you need to complete registration
- Contact support if stuck

## How the System Works Without WHOIS API

Even without the WHOIS API, the system still provides:
- Basic domain reachability check
- SSL certificate information (includes expiry)
- DNS resolution checks
- HTTP/HTTPS validation

## To Fix the WHOIS Integration

1. **Get the Correct API Key:**
   - Log into: https://whoisxmlapi.com/dashboard
   - Navigate to "API Keys" or "WHOIS API"
   - Copy the active API key

2. **Update the Environment Variable:**
   ```bash
   # In .env.local
   WHOIS_API_KEY=your_correct_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Test the Integration:**
   ```javascript
   // Quick test in browser console or Node.js
   fetch('https://www.whoisxmlapi.com/whoisserver/WhoisService?apiKey=YOUR_KEY&domainName=google.com&outputFormat=JSON')
     .then(r => r.json())
     .then(data => console.log(data))
   ```

## Alternative: Use Without API Key

The system is designed to work without the WHOIS API. It will:
- Skip detailed WHOIS information
- Still perform all other SEO checks
- Use SSL certificate for domain age approximation
- Check domain accessibility

## Contact WhoisXMLAPI Support

If the API key continues to fail:
- Email: support@whoisxmlapi.com
- Include your account email
- Ask for the correct WHOIS API key (not Domain Availability API)

## Environment Variables to Update

### Local (.env.local)
```env
WHOIS_API_KEY=your_working_api_key
```

### Vercel Dashboard
Add the same key to: https://vercel.com/johan-cilliers-projects/online-client-reporting-new/settings/environment-variables

The system will continue to work perfectly without WHOIS data - it's an optional enhancement!
